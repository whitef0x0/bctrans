## Pyschological Evalution
While in Canada there is a right to get HRT without psychological evaluation, most doctors will refuse to see you without one. 
Futhermore to change your name, you will require a psychological evaluation anyways, so best to get one as early as possible


### Option 1 (*Reccomended*): Self Evaluation
Cost: 300-1000$ CAD (depending on therapist)


### Option 2 (If you are under 18): Childrens Hospital
Children's Hospital has great resources for trans youth 18 years and under. They will help you with psychological evalutions, HRT
and continuing medical care as well as direct you to trans-friendly therapists

### Option 3 (If you are under 25): Three Bridges Clinic
Three Bridges Clinic is a Trans/LGBTQ+ clinic for youth 25 and under. However in my experience they are a bit disorganized and getting an
appointment with them can be tough. If you decide to go this route, your best bet is to try and book an intake appointment in person.

A positive of Three Bridges is that it is funded under MSP so 

## Voice Training


### Vancouver-based Voice Therapists
The one voice therapist in Vancouver I can recommend is Sherri Zelazny, who runs [Abilities Rehabilitation](https://www.abilitiesrehabilitation.com/service/surrey-voice-clinic/) in
South Surrey. You may see Shelagh Davies, who is a wonderful speech therapist popup, but she is currently retired and is no longer able to help.

### Changing Keys
[Changing Keys](http://www.phsa.ca/transcarebc/care-support/transitioning/chng-speech)
Changing Keys is a MSP-funded (and therefore free for PRs/Citizens) voice training program run by TransCareBC. It is an intensive program run for 7 weeks featuring
the top voice therapists from BC, including Sherri Zelazny. However since it is MSP funded, the waiting list is quite long (I have been on it since August and haven't heard back 
since about any open spots), so if you can afford it going private may be fastest option.

### Online-based Voice Therapists
1. [Voicelab](https://www.thevoicelabinc.com)
I currently work with Katharine at VoiceLab, a singing and trans voice therapy company based in Chicago, IL. Unlike practioners like Sherri, the Voice Lab approaches 
trans voice therapy from a musical/singing background, which may be a positive or negative based on what you are looking for. 
If you want to improve your talking voice and singing voice and enjoy having fun with sometimes less pratical work then Voicelab is great, however it 
will not be as laser focused or as pratical as a constructionist/theraputic approach that you will get with someone like Sherri Zelazny.
