## Pyschological Evalutions
While in Canada there is a right to get HRT without psychological evaluation, most doctors will refuse to see you without one. 
Futhermore to change your name, you will require a psychological evaluation anyways, so best to get one as early as possible

If you decide to pursue GRS/SRS within Canada, you will also need a seperate "Surgery Assessment" performed by a pyschologist/registered therapist.

**Note: Your evaluator must be a doctor or pyschologist that is licensed to practice in Canada**

### Option 1 (*Reccomended*): Self Evaluation
Cost: 300-1000$ CAD (depending on therapist)

Wait: 1-2 weeks

**Note**: Most psychologists will not be familiar or willing to do a psychological evaluation and diagnosis of transgender dysphoria, so make sure to check with your psychologist before making an appointment

Transgender-friendly Psychologists:
1. Dr. Melady Preece (**Recommended**)

  Website: [drmeladypreece.com](https://www.drmeladypreece.com/)
  
  Online Booking: ✔️
  
  Cost: 525$ (2x 90 min sessions)
  
2. Dr. Aline Wydra

  Website: [alinawydra.com](https://alinawydra.com/)
  
  Online Booking: ❌
  
  Cost: TBD

### Option 2 (If you are under 18): Childrens Hospital
Cost: Free (if a BC resident)

Wait: 1-2 months?

Children's Hospital has great resources for trans youth 18 years and under. They will help you with psychological evalutions, HRT
and continuing medical care as well as direct you to trans-friendly therapists

### Option 3 (If you are under 25): Three Bridges Clinic
Cost: Free (if a BC resident)

Wait: 3-6 months

Three Bridges Clinic is a Trans/LGBTQ+ clinic for youth 25 and under. However in my experience they are a bit disorganized and getting an
appointment with them can be tough. If you decide to go this route, your best bet is to try and book an intake appointment in person. A positive of Three Bridges is that the psychological evalution and medical treatment with HRT is done all under one roof which makes the process streamlined once you can get around their disorganized appointment booking. 

## Voice Training

### Vancouver-based Voice Therapists
The one voice therapist in Vancouver I can recommend is Sherri Zelazny, who runs [Abilities Rehabilitation](https://www.abilitiesrehabilitation.com/service/surrey-voice-clinic/) in
South Surrey. You may see Shelagh Davies, who is a wonderful speech therapist popup, but she is currently retired and is no longer able to help.

### Changing Keys
[Changing Keys](http://www.phsa.ca/transcarebc/care-support/transitioning/chng-speech)
Changing Keys is a MSP-funded (and therefore free for PRs/Citizens) voice training program run by TransCareBC. It is an intensive program run for 7 weeks featuring
the top voice therapists from BC, including Sherri Zelazny. However since it is MSP funded, the waiting list is quite long (I have been on it since August and haven't heard back 
since about any open spots), so if you can afford it going private may be fastest option.

### Online-based Voice Therapists
1. [Voicelab](https://www.thevoicelabinc.com)
I currently work with Katharine at VoiceLab, a singing and trans voice therapy company based in Chicago, IL. Unlike practioners like Sherri, the Voice Lab approaches trans voice therapy from a musical/singing background, which may be a positive or negative based on what learning style suits you best.

If you want to improve your talking voice and singing voice and enjoy having fun with sometimes less pratical work then Voicelab is great, however it will not be as laser focused or as pratical as a constructionist/theraputic approach that you will get with someone like Sherri Zelazny.

## Hair Removal (for MTF)

### Laser
- THE TEN SPOT
Website: [thetenspot.com](http://thetenspot.com)

## Name Change
Before starting your name change in BC, makes user you have had your psychological evalution completed before starting
